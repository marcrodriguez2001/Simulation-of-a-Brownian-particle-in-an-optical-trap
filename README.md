# Simulation of a Brownian particle in an optical trap
Recreation of the numerical experiments presented in the paper *Simulation of a Brownian Particle in an Optical Trap* (DOI https://doi.org/10.1119/1.4772632). 

## FILES
There is a notebook for each section of the paper:
- *II.Simulation of white noise.ipynb*  to the simulations presented in Section II of the paper
- *III.From ballistic motion to brownian diffusion.ipynb*  to the simulations presented in Section III of the paper
- *IV.Optical Traps.ipynb*  to the simulations presented in Section IV of the paper
- *V.Further numerical experiments.ipynb*  to the simulations presented in Section V of the paper

Finally, in the file *"Recreation_of_Numerical_Simulations_of_a_Brownian_Particle_in_an_Optical_Trap.pdf"*, you will find a brief report summarizing the generated code, the implementation and results.

## HOW TO RUN?
The notebooks can be downloaded and run without problems. You only need Python 3, Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook, NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.
